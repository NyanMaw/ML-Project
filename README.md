# ML-Project
A local project to do some proof-of-concept for the application of some machine learning models. This app/project relies on existing APIs and libraries to function, including OpenAI's API and some of OpenCV's available libraries.

This is done on Windows.
Ensure Docker-Desktop is installed.
This is meant to be run locally on your computer.

#To start frontend:
Go to the frontend directory in your terminal. Type "npm start" and hit enter. It should run on localhost at port 3000.
#To start backend:
For first timers, go to the backend directory in your terminal. Type "docker-compose build" and hit enter. This will take a while, but only needs to be done once.
Go to the backend directory in your terminal. Type "docker-compose up" and hit enter. It should run on localhost at port 8000.
